<p>The Lumieres brothers produced this film by placing a camera next to the tracks and started filming as the train approached. The train is seen arriving at a distance until it runs past the edge of the screen before coming to a stop. There are stories that when the audience saw this film they became frightened thinking they were going to be hit by the train, but in reality that was not the case. The audience knew what they were looking at were simply projected images that were not in natural color nor dimension. However the film is being credited with being the first thriller movie.</p>
